### Chatbot311-development

<em>CUNY Hackathon 2017-- Chatbot 311</em> 

User friendly methods would greatly improve the functionality on New York public websites. We should be able to search and  access information that is requested on our own terms.The open records project made it possible for people to find information, preserve historical records, and New York City government publications.

<em>The Problem Statement:</em>		

The IBM Watson software bridges the gap between the screen as an interface and the screen as a tool for complex interaction with visual recognition, speech, and “phrase words”. Based on examples from the IBM Watson developer platform: Retrieve and Rank, Discovery, and Visual Recognition can be tools for classification of unstructured data from Government publications, 311, or Open Data services.

<em>Solution Options:</em>
					
We propose developing a cloud based web application that would be the ultimate guide to New York City. We would need to train Watson on every aspect of DORIS. We have agreed that the layout of a web application is important to communicate and deliver content for the user. A new user interface can be implemented to focus on the visual shape of an object, and less on the textual property. This type of design interface would stress the relational model that each object has to the total set of objects. The relation that the object has to itself and the surrounding set of objects would then become the significant concept for this service. As government functions transition, and move online a user interface such as a chatbot may be able to help deliver questions in an alternative format.

The IBM Watson software bridges the gap between the screen as an interface and the screen as a tool for complex interaction through visual, speech, and phrase word recognition. Citizens and tourists alike could simply ask a question with a Watson conversation chatbot. Watson would search the database of the New York City website. Then, would answer the question by sending a query to the public API, and updating future responses as well. 

<em>Viability:</em>
					
We will utilize the IBM Bluemix Services in development with limited cost. This will provide an environment in which we could develop a rapid prototype solution. We think a plan to build a free application of a half a GB of free memory every month is plausible.

We also intend to use the Bluemix garage facility for startups
